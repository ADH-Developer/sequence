### Features

* **Segment your customers** by Events or Person Attributes via our Audience Builder
* **Send targeted emails** to your Audiences
* **Search and filter through customer data** from multiple sources \(Segment, API, SDK, with Intercom and CSV coming soon\)
* **GraphQL API and HTTP API** for data import/export

### **Principles**

* **Data should be easy to import** - We offer a very flexible API for importing data, an NPM module, and a reverse ETL for batching importing data via SQL \(coming soon\)
* **Data should be easy to export** - By using our API, you'll be able to query for any data you need. Plus, an out-of-the-box ETL to move marketing specific data \(clicks, opens, and other campaign metrics\) into your data warehouse
* **Built for marketers, but powered by data teams** - Marketing and data should go hand in hand. We offer best in class data capabilities with a clean and intuitive UX for non-technical users. 

### **Coming Soon**
