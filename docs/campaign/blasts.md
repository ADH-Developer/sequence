A **Blast** is a one off message sent to a list of customers.

### Requirements

To send an email blast to your users, you'll need:

1. User data to populate an **Audience**
2. A Sendgrid API Key located in `/packages/api/.env` under `SENDGRID_API_KEY`

We also recommend you have **Event** data populated so you can query based on Events and Event Attributes.
