# Overview

### Today

Sequence is an open-core email marketing automation tool. It allows you to send a one-off email to a list of people. 

### The Vision

Sequence will be the bridge between data teams and data-driven marketers, allowing marketers to unlock the full potential of their customer data. 

### Problem

Marketing is more complex than ever, and with so much customer data being generated, you would think that launching highly targeted messaging campaigns is a breeze. However, we find that that's not the case:

1. **Marketing data is siloed and opaque**. For many marketers, creating highly targeted multi-channel campaigns is more difficult than ever. Simply put: there's a lot of data but the right people don't have access to it. Today, marketers have to constantly ask for email lists from their data team. Marketers should be able to use all available data to build highly target campaigns. 
2. **Marketing software has terrible reporting.** Understanding critical questions like, "how many customers in a campaign actually purchased the product?" requires end to end analytics that combines marketing, product, and sales data. However, marketing tools aren't meant for answering complex questions across multiple data "objects." We believe that best in class marketing tools will allow marketers to ask these complex questions natively in one tool.
3. **Data exploration is difficult for non-SQL users.** Even when the data is combined in a warehouse and exposed via a BI tool, most marketers don't know SQL. This makes it difficult to explore schemas and ask questions via BI tools. Marketers should be able to create customer segments and analyze campaign success without knowing SQL. 
4. **Business intelligence dashboards for marketing are too high-level and don't inform campaign strategy.** Even when marketers have access to BI dashboards to inform their marketing strategy, dashboards typically answer executive level questions and don't inform day to day decision making because the queries aren't granular enough to target individual campaigns or specific segments. Marketing dashboards should be quick to make, easy to maintain, and provide insights into day to day campaign performance. 

### Solution

Our vision is to create a marketing automation software that puts data teams and business intelligence at its core:

1. **Allow for native access to your database\(s\).** Engineers should be able to connect to their data warehouse via a native connection in our product, eliminating the need for data pipelines and synchronization across multiple tools. 
2. **Expose the right information and catalog the schema.** Data teams can catalog queries and important customer attributes in a simple interface, which will standardize query definitions, eliminate customer lists in CSVs, and improve collaboration between marketing and data.
3. **Native integration with BI tools.** For teams that already have a BI tool, we will integrate with their existing BI tool's query library so marketers can see customer attributes and segments as quickly as data scientists can write SQL. 
4. **Create A/B tests and track campaign performance.** Setup A/B tests for your campaigns and measure impact on growth and revenue in a statistically meaningful way. 

### Why Open-Core?

Our vision is possible only with direct integration into our customers' data warehouse. We believe that the next generation of SaaS marketing products will operate within private clouds, rather than requiring expensive ETL for both incoming and outgoing data. This means that the code should be auditable by companies to provide trust in our software. 

It's reminiscent to days before Salesforceâ€”when companies' owned their entire stack within their own walls, except today the servers are in the cloud and separated from the world by firewalls.
