# Overview

### Today

Sequence is an open-core email marketing automation tool. It allows you to send a one-off email to a list of people. 

### The Vision

Sequence will be the bridge between data teams and data-driven marketers, allowing marketers to unlock the full potential of their customer data. 

### Problem

Marketing is more complex than ever, and with so much customer data being generated, you would think that launching highly targeted messaging campaigns is a breeze. However, we find that that's not the case:

1. **Marketing data is siloed and opaque**. For many marketers, creating highly targeted multi-channel campaigns is more difficult than ever. Simply put: there's a lot of data but the right people don't have access to it. Today, marketers have to constantly ask for email lists from their data team. Marketers should be able to use all available data to build highly target campaigns. 
2. **Marketing software has terrible reporting.** Understanding critical questions like, "how many customers in a campaign actually purchased the product?" requires end to end analytics that combines marketing, product, and sales data. However, typical marketing tools aren't meant for answering complex questions across multiple data "objects." We believe that best in class marketing tools will allow marketers to ask these complex questions natively in one tool.
3. **Data exploration is difficult for non-SQL users.** Even when the data is combined in a warehouse and exposed via a BI tool, most marketers don't know SQL. This makes it difficult to explore schemas and ask questions via typical VI tools. Marketers should be able to create customer segments and analyze campaign success without knowing SQL. 
4. **Business intelligence dashboards for marketing are too high-level and don't inform campaign strategy.** 

### Solution

Our vision is to create a marketing automation software that puts data teams and business intelligence at its core:

1. **Allow for native access to your database\(s\).** Build your customer lists by connecting to your data warehouse natively in our product. 
2. **Catalog your marketing data more effectively.** Data teams can build a catalog of queries and customer attributes to make available to marketers in one tool, improving collaboration and iteration speed. 
3. **Native integration with BI tools.** For teams that already have a BI tool, integrate with their BI tool's query library to answer questions involving sales, product, and billing data in a marketing focused way. 
4. **Create A/B tests and track campaign performance.** Be fully data-driven with your marketing and ensure that campaign success is based on real results.
