# Creating an Email

### Creating an Email

Use the Email Editor view to create an email. Emails should have a name \(see the title bar\) for easy reference. 

Emails are automatically saved on edit.

We support plain text emails with full HTML support coming soon.

You can use any variable from your **Person** attributes in your email. It will be automatically converted to the proper value at send time.
